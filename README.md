# Split Group
An extension for CiviCRM. This function takes a group of contacts, and splits
it into several new smaller groups, each with some maximum number of contacts.
The original group is left untouched.

### Installation
Install in the usual ways, either from the CiviCRM extensions repository or
by downloading directly from GitHub. If you download a snapshot you may need
to rename the extension's directory to the extension's key
(`uk.org.futurefirst.networks.splitgroup`).

### Features
* Split large groups of contacts into smaller groups- for example,
in order to send large mailshots out in batches
* Provides an API function Group.Split
* Provides an easy-to-use form where you can select the base group
and the required maximum size of the split groups
